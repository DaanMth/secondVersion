Welcome to my portfolio page, here you can read all about my internship I have done at the company Cesbit located in Weert. I have divided this page in several parts, an introduction about myself, the sprints and what I have done in them, and more. You can find those subjects right here or on the sidebar on the right when going through all the files. 
I hope you enjoy reading about my internship!
